      <h3>Operating System Functions</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>An <strong>operating system</strong> is a collection of programs that the computer uses to manage itself and use its resources efficiently. It shields the user of the
        machine from the low-level details of the machine&rsquo;s hardware operation and provides frequently needed facilities.</p>

              <p>A computer system can be broken down into 4 primary layers, some hardware and some software. The purpose of layered design is to enable a given operating system
                and applications to run on different hardware.</p>

      <p>The Operating System, or OS, is the program that manages the interaction between the user, other programs, system resources and the computer peripherals. Most major OSs
        use a <strong>Graphical User Interface</strong> (GUI) to interact with the user. The most common OSs for laptops and desktops are Windows, OSX for the Macintosh, and
        Unix/Linux.</p>
      <p>Network Servers, mobile devices and other devices may use a different version of these common operating systems, or a completely different OS. Network servers might not
        use a GUI interface, but might still use a command line for the interaction with the network administrator.</p>

      <h4>File Management</h4>
      <p>We <strong>manage</strong> files by saving them in folders in a hierarchical file system. A file can contain a program, a text document, an image, or other data. To an
        operating system, a data file is simply a sequence of bytes, and it is the responsibility of the software program reading the file to understand the meaning and internal
        layout of the information. </p>
      <p>It is helpful to understand file management concepts by relating them to a paper-filing system, such as a file cabinet. The <strong>root directory</strong> is the first or
        top-most directory. It is like the <em>room</em> that the file cabinet is stored in.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the Windows operating system, the root directory is assigned a letter, such as &ldquo;c:\&rdquo; or &ldquo;d:\&rdquo;. </li>
        <li>In the Unix/Linux operating system, the root directory is denoted &ldquo;/&rdquo;. </li>
      </ul>

        <tbody>

            <td>
              <p>In a <strong>flat file system</strong>, all files are placed in the root directory. As the number of files grows, it becomes more and more difficult to manage this
                type of file system.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>This is like having papers strewn about your room, with no drawers to put them in.</p>

                <li>In Windows, examples of high-level directories are &ldquo;C:\Windows&rdquo; or &ldquo;C:\Program Files&rdquo;.</li>

              <p>Directories may have sub-directories, which are like <em>folders</em> in the drawers. Files may be placed in the root directory (room), the high-level directories

            <ul>
              <li>overwrite the file, </li>
              <li>indicate that the file may not be placed here, or </li>

            <li>put the date in the name, (format yyyy-mm-dd) or include numbers (ex: version #) to help the files sort into a logical order. </li>
            <li>Be as descriptive as possible. Bad: project. Good: File Exercise 1</li>

      <h4>Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
      <p>With the prevalence of GUI-based OSs, many computer users are dependent upon their mouse or touchscreen to navigate their computer. Before GUIs were commonly available,
        all computer users had to be familiar with keyboard based commands to accomplish tasks. This could mean typing the word "rename" when renaming a file, or using the function
        keys at the top of your keyboard to save a file in a word processor.</p>
      <p>Take a moment to read through the following websites that give some tips and advice on using keyboard shortcuts. </p>
