      <h3>Software Products</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>Software are the instructions that a computer is designed to follow. We cannot see software, and cannot watch it in operation. A piece of software is always in
        <strong>machine language</strong> and is always represented by 1s and 0s in the computer itself.</p>
      <p>Software is first written in a special programming language, such as Java, Python, Ruby, C/C++, etc. and then it is either <strong>interpreted</strong> as machine
        language, or converted into machine language by a special program called a <strong>compiler</strong>. <em>(A compiler is a piece of software that converts specific
          programming languages into the machine language of specific computers.) </em>It is also possible to write software in a language similar to that of the computer called
        Assembly, which is specific to the processor. </p>
      <p>In general, there are two broad categories of software: System Software and Application Software.</p>
      <h4>System Software</h4>
      <p>Software is used from the moment the computer starts. All the software used in the startup of the computer system and used to allow interaction with the user is called
        <strong>System Software</strong>. This type of software is not directly called up by the user and much of it is automatically loaded when the computer starts. (The only
        type of System Software that is not automatically loaded is Utility Software.)</p>
      <p>The following is a list of common System Software and its sub-types:</p>

      <p>It is difficult to list every piece of System Software a particular computer might use, because each computer might have different devices, or have some pieces of software
        integrated into each other. :</p>
      <h4>Application Software</h4>
      <p>Application Software is software designed to be used by someone for a specific purpose. The software might be intended to allow people to write documents using a computer.
        An application could also be created for drawing, to simulate an aircraft, or it could be created as a game. Regardless of the ultimate purpose, applications are usually
        meant to be used by people or for people.</p>
      <h5>Productivity or Business Applications</h5>

            <td>
              <p>Most applications that people use everyday are Productivity Applications such as word processors, spreadsheets, presentation software, and databases. Often these
                applications are bundled into a Business Suite. Examples of these suites are MSOffice and OpenOffice. However, many business applications are sold as stand-alone
                products, these include design software such as Autodesk, desktop publishing software, database software, and software specifically designed for inventory and
                sales.</p>

              <p>Programs that are designed to help the user create and edit images and videos are Graphics Applications. Like Productivity software, Graphics applications are
                often bundled so that several related pieces of software can be purchased as one. Two examples of this are the Adobe CS suites and the Corel Draw Suites. Some
                graphics applications, such as Gimp and Blender are very powerful, but are free.</p>

                keep their audience interested.</p>

              <p>Networks are when two or more computers are interconnected in order for the machines to share resources, such as printers, for communications, and/or services. In
                order to accomplish any of these software has to be designed to allow for it. Some software acts as a service to allow a number of computers access to the same
                device, a printer, a scanner, or a modem. A different set of software is required to allow one computer to act as a remote hard drive for other computers. The
                internet is itself a network service, a large number of computers provide 'internet services' which are accessed by a 'client' that can request and receive the
                responses of the servers. Software is needed for the servers, for the client and for the two machines to interact.</p>

            <td>Shortly after the Internet became popular a number of ISPs (Internet Service Providers) offered their clients the ability to receive, write and store their email
              on-line. Hotmail was a pioneer in this service. Since then, and especially in the last ten years a number of companies have developed applications that work as
              services through an internet browser. Among the most famous of these applications is Google Docs and Google Maps. These applications are not like the Productivity
              Applications; they do not exist in any form on the computers in front of you. Nor are they like the Network Applications which are based on a client/server model,
              where the client is designed specifically for the intended purpose. </td>

      <p>Internet Applications require services from the Internet and an appropriate bowser. The experience of this type of software is not as rich as that of the stand-alone
        productivity applications, but the ease of use, the 'cloud' based storage, and the collaborative functionality of the applications has its own value.</p>
      <h5>Development Applications</h5>
      <p>The creation of computer programs really only requires a text file (like one created with Notepad) which contains the computer code in a programming language, a linker and
        a compiler. A debugger and some help files are helpful too. Writing code in this way can take a lot of time, and requires a great deal of time to learn. </p>
      <p>Programs that are used to create software are called Development Applications. In this course we make use of an <strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong> (IDE)
        that contains all of the programs needed to create software in one large program. These more professional IDEs are very modular permitting components for different
        languages and circumstances to be <em>plugged in </em>as needed. Help files are easily integrated in the IDEs, and modern IDEs use colour coding of the code and syntax help
        to make the code easier to read and the programming proceed more quickly.</p>

                  have all the necessary pieces to write the software in that type of code. The compiler is a program designed for a specific programming language, so the compiler
                  is run from <em>within </em>the IDE.</span></p>
