      <h4><strong>Your Computer's Hardware</strong></h4>
      <p>While programmers do not deal directly with the hardware it is important to know a bit about your your computer's hardware.</p>
      <p><strong>Hardware</strong> is <em><strong>any part of your computer that you can physically touch</strong></em>.</p>
      <p>Although computer hardware varies greatly from machine to machine, all computers will have hardware that falls into the following four categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Input devices:</strong> Any device that allows raw data to be entered into the computer system.</li>
        <li><strong>System Unit: </strong>The system unit takes raw data from the input devices, processes the data into useful information and then sends it to the output devices.
          A metal enclosure or &ldquo;case&rdquo; contains the internal components of the computer. </li>
        <li><strong>Storage Units:</strong> Sometimes known as "secondary" or "auxiliary" storage. This is where information can be stored so that it can be retrieved at a later
          date.</li>
        <li><strong>Output devices:</strong> Any device that takes processed data and displays it in a meaningful way.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Input and output devices can also be referred to as <strong>peripheral</strong> or <strong>external devices</strong>.</p>

              <p>Computer storage and memory is often measured in megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), and more recently, terabytes (TB). Currently, most new computers come with 4GB or

              <p></p>

              <p><strong>Memory</strong> (RAM &amp; ROM) is the place that the computer stores information while it is in operation. Working memory is used to store the computer

      <h4>Clock Speeds</h4>
      <p>When purchasing a computer, the clock speed of the CPU is another important consideration. Clock speed refers to how fast a processor can process information, make
        calculations, or perform operations. More specifically, it is the number of times, in a second, the processor can turn a signal on and off again.</p>
      <p>Take a look at some sample clock speeds in the table below:</p>

              <p><strong>Optional:</strong> Want more in-depth knowledge?</p>
              <p>The BIOS uses ROM memory in the form of PROM, EPROM or EEPROM for the basic input and output (BIOS) instructions of the computer. The expensive, but powerful
                static RAM is used to hold items in the CPU or the computer cache so that the processor has ready access to the instructions and/or data that it is currently using.
                The various form of dynamic RAM that is used as working memory of the computer has come in a variety of forms, from SDRAM, to DDR SDRAM, to DDR2 and DDR3 found in
                modern computers.</p>
              <p>The following video provides a more detailed description of the types of memory used in the computer system and how they are used. In particular the video looks at
                the BIOS stored in PROMS, EPROMS, and EEPROMS, the use of SRAM for caches on CPUs, and the use SDRAMS, DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 for DRAM.</p>
