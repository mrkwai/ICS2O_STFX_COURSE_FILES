      <h3>Home Computer Networking</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>As we saw in Activity 2, there are a number of software applications that require a network to function. In this activity we will briefly outline some basic networking
        concepts.</p>
      <p>A network is a set of technologies that connects computers, which allows communication and collaboration between users. Networks exist for a variety of purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sharing: applications, data, or hardware components like a printer.</li>
        <li>Communication: email, instant messaging, video conferencing, VoIP (Voice over IP)</li>
        <li>Entertainment: games, streaming TV shows &amp; movies</li>
        <li>Data Backup: keeping copies of files in different locations in case of data loss.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many homes and small companies have a <strong>LAN</strong> - a local area network. This refers to a small network of 2 or more computers that is contained within one
        building. Companies that have buildings in multiple locations will require a <strong>WAN</strong> (wide area network), which covers a number of buildings and possibly even
        buildings in different cities. A WAN is essentially two or more LANs that are connected.</p>
      <h4>Home Network Setup</h4>
      <p>To set up a LAN there are certain hardware components that are needed. Check at home to see what your setup is <em>(hint: You will need this information for your
          assignment!)</em></p>

                through a USB port or card reader. The two major types of NICs are those intended for wired networks and those intended for wireless networks. Many NICs require a
                driver to communicate with the computer's OS.</p>

              <p><strong>DSL or Cable Modem.</strong> A DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) or cable modem is used to translate the transmissions from the medium (twisted pair or coaxial
                cable) used by your <strong>Internet Service Provider</strong> (ISP) to those of a standard network (Ethernet). Modems usually also function as a
                <strong>gateway</strong>: it is the place where the user logs into the ISP, receives a network address and connects to the network as a whole. Many modern modems
                also contain a built-in router and wireless access point, though you can install your own if you wish.</p>

                another modem connected to the other computer or network would translate the analog audio signals back into digital information.<strong> </strong></p>

                Many routers also contain built-in hubs or switches, which allow multiple computers to connect to the network.</p>

                <strong>all</strong> connected computers, while a switch sends the packet <strong>only</strong> to the intended recipient.</p>

      <p><strong>Internet Protocol (IP)</strong>: defines the IP address of the computer. Many computers still use the IPv4 standard, which is a 32-bit address consisting of four
        8-bit numbers (Ex: 172.22.40.225). However, The number of devices attached to the Internet has become so large that this address scheme is slowly being updated to a new
        scheme called IPv6. The IPv6 standard uses 128-bit addresses, consisting of 16 8-bit numbers (Ex: 2001:0db8:85a3:08d3:1319:8a2e:0370:7334)</p>

      <p><strong>DNS (Domain Name System):</strong> A protocol used to resolve a domain name, such as ocsb.ca, to an IP address. A DNS server has access to a list of the IP
