      <h3>Building a Dream Computer</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>Now that we have reviewed all the essential components of a computer system, you will have a chance to (virtually) build one for a particular user. You may choose a user
        profile from the list provided, or create your own profile (must be approved by your teacher!)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a student on a fixed budget</li>

      <h3><br />Assignment: Build a Dream Computer</h3>
      <hr />
      <h4 class="h4_assignment_title"><img class="icon" src="../resources/images/assignment.gif" alt="Assignment Icon" />Summative Assignment</h4>
      <div class="dropbox">
        <p>You must carefully consider what <strong>hardware</strong> will be required (including any
          peripherals or AV equipment needed), what <strong>operating system</strong> will best support this user, what <strong>software</strong> they will need (you must ensure it
          can run on your chosen operating system!), what <strong>networking</strong> equipment and services they will need, and what products or services your user will require
          for <strong>maintenance and security </strong>purposes. More details for each of these topics is provided below.</p>

        <h4><strong>Part A: Hardware</strong> </h4>
        <p>Will you <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/building-vs-buying-a-pc-832692" target="_blank" >build the computer from parts or purchase a
            pre-built system</a>? Desktop or laptop? Do you need to buy your user a keyboard, mouse or screen? Will your user need a printer, scanner, speakers or microphone? What
          about other specialized components? Consider <a href="http://www.yourdictionary.com/computer-ergonomics" target="_blank" >ergonomics</a> in your
          purchases too! For each component you buy, you must include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>picture</strong> of the component <strong>that includes the name &amp; price (use a screenshot tool if needed)</strong></li>
          <li>A <strong>link</strong> to the store website or online retailer where you could purchase the component.</li>
          <li><strong>Justification</strong> for why this component is needed for your particular user. This justification should include any relevant specifications about the
            component (speed, size, compatibility with other components, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Record all the costs of the components on the <b>spreadsheet</b> provided on the second evidence card! This spreadsheet will add up all the costs, calculate HST and give a total!</p>

        <h4><strong>Part B: Operating System </strong></h4>
        <p>Does your system from Part A come with an operating system already installed? Will you be installing and configuring the OS yourself? Consider the strengths and
          weaknesses of each operating system (remember your Activity 3 task?) and <strong>make sure your operating system will meet your user's needs</strong>. </p>
          <p>Write a brief paragraph <strong>justifying</strong> your choice. Be sure to note any additional <strong>costs</strong> (if applicable) that were not accounted for in Part A on your spreadsheet.</p>

        <h4>Part C: Software</h4>
        <p>What <strong>application software</strong> will your user need? Will they need productivity, graphics, multimedia, network, Internet or development applications? Will
          you splurge for paid versions or make use of (reputable) free software? For each software application or suite (bundle of applications) you must provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>image</strong> for the software (usually a logo)</li>
          <li>A <strong>link</strong> to the store website or online retailer where you could purchase and/or download the software.</li>
          <li>A screenshot or list of the <strong>system requirements</strong> for the software. Make sure it will run on the hardware and OS you have selected!</li>
          <li><strong>Justification</strong> of why this software is needed for your particular user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Record any <strong>costs</strong> of the software that your user requires on your spreadsheet. If some of the software includes a subscription
          component, place the cost in the correct column of the spreadsheet (monthly or yearly) </p>

        <h4>Part D: Networking</h4>
        <p>Will your user require Internet access? A home network? Wireless connectivity? In this part you will research <a href="http://www.canadianisp.ca" target="_blank"
            >ISPs (Internet Service Providers)</a> available in your area and choose an<strong> Internet package</strong> that will meet your user's needs.
          You will also need to describe what additional <strong>networking hardware</strong> your user will require (is a modem rental fee included in the contract? Do you need a
          separate router, hub/switch or wireless access point? Don't forget about cabling, if needed!)</p>
        <p>Write a brief paragraph <strong>justifying</strong> your choices. Include <strong>screenshots</strong> for any component you buy, as well as
          a <strong>link</strong> to the website. Record the <strong>total startup cost</strong> of networking this computer (hardware &amp; connection fees),
          plus what your user will have to <strong>pay monthly</strong> for maintaining the service in your spreadsheet.</p>

        <h4>Part E: Maintenance &amp; Security</h4>
        <p>Finally, which <strong>software</strong> or <strong>products</strong> will your user need to help maintain this computer? Consider: antivirus or anti-malware software,
          backups, firewalls, cleaning products, etc. Again, include <strong>screenshots</strong> for any software or product you buy, as well as a
          <strong>link</strong> to the website. Include the <strong>costs</strong>, including any monthly/yearly costs for subscription services, that your
          user will pay for maintenance &amp; security on their system on your spreadsheet.</p>

        <hr />
        <p>Your assignment must include a spreadsheet with <strong>all costs</strong> for the new computer system, as well as all relevant recurring costs (monthly, yearly, etc)
          so your user can give their final approval. While there is <strong>no set budget</strong> for your 'purchases', you must keep in mind the likely financial situation of
          the user that you have chosen. (i.e. consider the accountant that must justify her purchases to her supervisor, the home business owner who needs to get a tax write-off
          from the government, the teenager who has to convince his parents, etc ...) So shop around and look for good deals!</p>

        <p>Use the evidence cards provided on Hapara for your submission.</h5>
