      <h3>How do I make a game?</h3>

      <hr />
      <p>Many students taking a computer science class do so because they enjoy using computers for entertainment purposes, such as gaming. So we will finish this course with
        learning about some resources to create games using the Python language.</p>

      <p>You have already had some experience working with the pygame module last unit; in this activity we will further that knowledge to help you create a fully working game</p>

              <p>Work through the following online tutorial: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAjkwJocj7vlc_mFU-4wXJq&amp;index=2" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  target="_blank">The New Boston&#39;s Pygame Tutorial, by sentdex</a>. In this tutorial he uses an <strong>incremental</strong> approach to game creation; which
                means that he builds up the functionality of his game little by little, always testing it to ensure that he has a running program at every stage.</p>

              <p>Tutorial #1 is about setting up pygame, which is done already.<br />
                Tutorials 2-21 buld the basic functionality for the snake game.<br />
                Tutorials 22-26 improve the collision detection part of the game.<br />
                Tutorials 27-36 improve the look and feel of the game.<br />
                Tutorials 37-39 add some finishing touches.</p>

      <p>To assist you in the creation of your game, an important reference is the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pygame API</a>.
        An API is an <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong>; which is a document that explains all of the variables, functions, and methods that you will need to make
        use of the code library.</p>

      <p>Another resource that you will find helpful is the online textbook: <a
          href="http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=introduction_to_graphics&amp;lang=en#section_5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Program Arcade Games with
          Pygame and Python</a>. <strong>Chapters 5, 8, 10 and 11</strong> will be most helpful to you in your game creation.</p>

      <div class="dropbox">

        <p>Save the following programs in the <strong>activity3</strong> package of your Unit 5 Python Project.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Work through the youtube tutorial shown above (I recommend completing <strong>at least up to #30</strong>)</li>
          <li>Improve the snake game by adding extra functionality (keep track of the highest score, add some sound, create different levels of difficulty, move the apples around
            the screen and make them bounce off the edges, etc)</li>
        </ol>
