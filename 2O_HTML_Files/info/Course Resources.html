      <h3>Course Materials</h3>
      <hr />

      <h4>Required Software &amp; Equipment</h4>
      <p>Students will be provided with most required hardware &amp; software by the school computer lab. However, there are other resources that students are strongly
        encouraged to bring with them to class to assist their progress in the course. Students are strongly encouraged to set up a computer with the required software
        at home as well.</p>
      <p>If a student brings a laptop to class, the teacher may assist as needed to install the required software. It is advised to do this setup early on in the course. </p>
      <p>At minimum, students should have access to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A computer (Windows, Mac, Linux) with an internet connection;</li>
        <li>Headphones/Headset, to listen to videos and tutorials without disturbing your classmates;</li>
        <li>A CSCircles account, available for free through the <a href="https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">Computer Science Circles website;</a></li>
        <li>A GitHub account, available for free through the <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub website;</a></li>
        <li>A download of the current <b><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">3.x Python SDK</a></b> (installed on school computers);</li>
        <li>Strongly Recommended: The <b><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/" target="_blank">Eclipse IDE</a></b> (installed on school computers);</li>
        <ul>
          <li>You will also need to install the PyDev plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace</li>
          <li>If you are planning to continue with ICS in grade 11, you might want to get the <b><a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html" target="_blank">Java SE 8 JDK from Oracle</a></b> (installed on school computers) <i>Note: You will need to create an Oracle Account to access the JDK. Please use the <a href="http://shh.ocsb.ca/" target=_blank>school contact information</a> when contact information is required</i></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Google Drive, Docs, Sheets &amp; Hapara, using the @ocsbstudent.ca account provided by the school;</li>
        <li>LucidChart, an add-on for Google Docs, linked to student's @ocsbstudent.ca account;</li>
        <li>Media player <em>(to view streamed video)</em>, generally a free download, if not already included with your browser;</li>
        <li>Flash and Shockwave players <em>(to view some linked demonstrations and activities)</em> -- generally a free download, if not already included with your browser;
          (Please note that Chrome will be removing their support for Flash players in December 2020, however a standalone player is available from these links: <a
            href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k2NLMwu_3t7Tqd_29TQm6hLmQhNfto6F" target=_blank>Windows</a>, <a
            href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jxtqPl8xSZy36iW3ftXdycz3uAOOJS3t" target=_blank>MacOS</a>, <a
            href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jqSKQEWRA_04qv9TLgT5oU9qdkIVvAUU" target=_blank>Linux</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Textbook</h4>

      <p>While there is no official textbook for this course, here are some online textbooks that you may find useful:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/" target=_blank>Think Python: How To Think Like A Computer Scientist</a></li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
      <hr />

      <p>Get ready to enjoy the excitement and challenge of programming using Python! In this course, you will plan and write simple computer programs, using fundamental
        programming concepts, and create clear and maintainable internal documentation. You will also learn about managing computers by studying hardware configurations, software
        selection, operating system functions, networking and safe computing practices. You will have a chance to investigate the social impact of computer technologies, and
        develop an understanding of environmental and ethical issues related to the use of computers.</p>

      <p>Listed below you will find some reminders to help you to be successful.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Check your <strong>@ocsbstudent.ca email</strong> regularly for updates and announcements!</li>
        <li>Check the <strong>calendar</strong> for <strong>due dates!</strong> It is your responsibility to meet these dates. If you have a problem with a due date, contact Mrs.
          Spindler.</li>
        <li>Regularly review assignment and evaluation criteria when completing assignments. Make a checklist to ensure that you have included everything, in the proper manner, and
          submitted it as requested by the due date. This again is <em>your responsibility</em>.</li>
        <li>Check and recheck the assignment rubrics. These documents hold a lot of important information that will help you achieve success in the course.</li>
        <li>Programming is a difficult skill to master. The key is repetition, repetition, and more repetition. When activities are assigned, make sure you step through them and
          complete the programs, but also go back and review things you aren't sure of. You might even want to create small programs on your own, just to review important code.
        </li>
        <li>The content pages hold the majority of new information for each activity. If you are struggling with an assignment, you may want to review the content page several
          times in order to become very familiar with the material.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't be afraid to ask for help!</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Assignment Submission</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>Due to the challenges of a hybrid schedule, I have made every effort to ensure fair and equitable due dates for all students. </p>

      <p>The due dates on the calendar and in Hapara are meant primarily as a pacing guideline. However, failure to complete the tasks <b>reasonably close (within 2-3 days)</b> to
        the provided due dates will hinder my ability to give you prompt feedback. Excessively late assignments run the risk of missing board mandated reporting timelines.</p>
      <p>Students must submit the daily tasks and assignments online as follows: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Written assignments will be submitted through Hapara.</li>
        <li>Coding assignments will be submitted through GitHub AND the corresponding evidence card in Hapara will be used to indicate task completion.</li>
      </ul>
