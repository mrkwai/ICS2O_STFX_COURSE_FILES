      <div class="dropbox">

        <p><b>Carefully read the following assignment. Ensure your code is in your repository on GitHub.com and that all evidence cards in Hapara are submitted.</b></p>

        <p>Save the following programs in the <strong>activity6</strong> package of your Python Project. </p>

        <p>BEFORE starting to code your program, you must plan your program with <strong>pseudocode</strong> OR a <strong>flowchart</strong> for the problem. Submit these using the Activity 6 evidence card in Hapara.</p>

        <p>Create a fun and engaging number guessing game. Your game must meet the following requirements:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The user will enter a maximum and minimum numeric value.</li>
            <li>The computer selects a random number in the range provided by the user.</li>
            <li>The user attempts to guess the number selected by the computer.</li>
            <li>After each guess an appropriate output is displayed and the user is prompted to try again.</li>
            <li>The game continues until the user guesses the correct number. The computer then displays the <b>number of attempts</b> to obtain the correct answer.</li>
            <li>Make sure that your output statements and input prompts are clear, and that your game is fun to play.</li>
            <li>You must follow all style conventions and use internal documentation to make your program easy to understand.</li>
          </ul>


          <br />
          <!-- <li>Create a quiz program with <b>five or more</b> questions on a topic of your choice. You can ask questions that require:
            <ul>
              <li>a number as an answer (e.g., What is 1+1?)</li>
              <li>text (e.g. What is Harry Potter's last name?)</li>
              <li>a selection (Which of these choices are correct? A, B, or C?)</li>
            </ul>
            Let the user know if he or she gets the question correct. <b>Print a message</b> depending on the user's answer.<br />
            Your program must <b>keep track</b> of how many questions they get correct.
            At the end of the program print the <b>percentage</b> of questions the user gets right.<br />
            Name the program <strong>Q2QuizProgram</strong>.</li> -->
