      <h3>Using Repetition Structures</h3>

      <hr />
      <p>Repetition in programming is the set of commands that allow the programmer to use code over and over. Repetition is one of the key tools programmers use to give their
        programs flexibility, while at the same time re-using good code and developing an overall predictability for the user. Well designed repetition can allow the programmer to
        save thousands of lines of code, while making programs more useful.</p>

      <p>There are three basic kinds of repetition:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>infinite repetition</li>
        <li>conditional repetition</li>
        <li>counted repetition</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All three have their uses. We will examine each type in this activity.</p>

      <h4><strong>Infinite Repetition</strong></h4>

      <p>Infinite repetition is a programming structure in which the program code is repeated endlessly. Programs that must always be running, operating systems, monitoring
        programs, or hardware drivers, for example, might be structured this way. The way to end a program in an infinite loop in Eclipse is to press the red stop button in
        output/console window. Infinite loops are easy to make, and are the basis of other types of repetition.</p>

      <p>The <em>syntax</em> for an infinite loop in Python is as follows:</p>

      <pre>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>while True</strong>:
    #code to be repeated
    #code to be repeated
</span></pre>

      <p>There are several things to notice about this <em>structure</em>. First, the command <strong>while True: </strong>is called the header. It designates the beginning of the
        structure. The code inside the structure is indented, which helps with code readability. Python also uses indentation to denote the start and end of all structures. The
        loop structure ends when the indenting ends. When the interpreter reaches the last indented line, it returns to the beginning of the repetition structure (the line after
        the header) and continues indefinitely.</p>

      <p>Infinite repetition is often used in graphics animation. By making small changes to the location of a shape on the screen, we can simulate movement.</p>

      <p>The program below shows a ball that is moving in a diagonal direction across the screen. Notice the position of the ball is stored in the variables <b>center_x</b> and
        <b>center_y</b>. Each frame these value are changed by a small amount.</p>

      <p>Try running this code in Eclipse. Since the loop is infinite, you will need to stop the program using the stop button <img src="images/A4StopButton.png" /> found on the
        Console view.

        <h4>Conditional Repetition</h4>

        <p>Conditional repetition is a repetition structure that includes a means of exiting the loop when a condition is met. This type of repetition gives the programmer an
          enormous amount of flexibility.</p>

        <p>The command</p>

        <pre>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>while &lt;<em>condition</em>&gt;<em>:</em></strong></span></pre>

        <p>is used as a header for a conditional loop. The <condition> is a special command that checks the status one or more variables, and forces an exit when the condition is
            not met. </condition>
        </p>

        <p>When a condition is met, we say the condition evaluates to <strong>True</strong>, and when the condition is not met, we say the condition evaluates to
          <strong>False</strong>.</p>

        <p>Python has a variable type, called <strong>bool</strong>, which is can only hold one of two possible values: <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>. So the
          <condition> in the header of a while loop could be replaced with a bool variable, with that variable being modified at some point in the loop to signal the loop&#39;s
            exit.</condition>
        </p>

        <h5>Comparison operators</h5>

        <p>One common way to create a <condition> is through the use <strong>comparison operators</strong>. </condition>
        </p>

        <p>Example: Given two numeric variables, <em>num</em> and <em>check</em>, which are initialized as follows:</p>

        <pre>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">num = 4
check = 3</span></pre>
        Conditional statements could be set up as follows:

        <table style="width: 680px;">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td style="width: 280px; text-align: center;">
                <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p>
              </td>
              <td style="width: 127.5px; text-align: center;">
                <p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
              </td>
              <td style="width: 151.5px; text-align: center;">
                <p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
              </td>
              <td style="width: 105px; text-align: center;">
                <p><strong>Result</strong></p>
              </td>
            </tr>

              <td style="text-align: center;">
                <p>True</p>

              <td style="text-align: center;">
                <p>check &lt; num</p>
              </td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">
                <p>True</p>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            <tr>
              <td>
                <p>check is less than or equal to num</p>
              </td>
              <td>
                <p style="text-align: center;">&lt;=</p>
              </td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">
                <p>check &lt;= num</p>
              </td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">
                <p>True</p>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The use of a condition in a loop means that the loop will be exited when the condition evaluates to False, and that code following the loop will be executed. The
          following is an example of a conditional loop.</p>


        <pre class="code">
# Counting using a conditional loop
# ICS2O Unit 4, Activity 4
# Created by R. Kuzmochka

num = 1

# Program Title
print (&quot;This program will count up from 1 to any number.&quot;)

    #increases the value of num by 1 on each repetition.
    num = num + 1

# Output an empty line for formatting and indicate end of program
print (&quot;&quot;)
print (&quot;Finished Counting&quot;)</pre>

        <h5>Boolean Operators</h5>

        <p>Another way to create a condition, or to make a condition more complex, is through the use of <strong>boolean operators</strong>. Python recognizes 3 boolean operators:
          <strong>and</strong>, <strong>or</strong> and <strong>not</strong>. Boolean operators are best described through the use of a truth table: a table that enumerates all the
          possible values and combinations of the input variables, and gives the resulting output.</p>

        <p>Example: Given two bool variables, <em>isCorrect</em> and <em>isDone</em>, the behaviour of the two boolean operators <strong>&quot;and&quot;</strong> &amp;
          <strong>&quot;or&quot;</strong> is as follows:</p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">isCorrect </span></td>
              <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">isDone </span></td>
              <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">isCorrect <strong>and</strong> isDone</span></td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">isCorrect </span></td>
              <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">isDone </span></td>
              <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">isCorrect <strong>or</strong> isDone</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The boolean <strong>&quot;not&quot;</strong> operator only takes one bool variable as input. It gives the opposite truth value as output. Example: given the bool
          variable isDone, the truth table for the not operator is:</p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">isDone </span></td>
              <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>not </strong>isDone</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td style="text-align: center;">True</td>
              <td style="text-align: center;">False</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h4>Counted Repetition</h4>

        <p>Counted repetition allows the programmer to set the number of repetitions in a structure. The structure of counted loops requires a <strong>header</strong> that sets
          an<strong> index variable</strong> and the <strong>range</strong> of the repetition. A counted loop that will repeat ten times, outputting the current repetition is as
          follows:</p>

        <pre>
for i in range(0, 10):
    print (i)
</pre>

        <p>In this example, the line</p>

        <pre>for i in range(0, 10):</pre>

        <p>is the <strong>header</strong> of the loop and creates an <strong>index variable</strong> called <strong>i</strong>. This is a variable that only exists within the loop.
          Each repetition of the counted loop is called an <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>

        <p>The <strong>range</strong> of the loop can be between any two positive integers. 0 can be used for the lower, or starting point of the range, but other integers can be
          used. Variables and/or constants can be used to set the range so long as they are integers. The value of the index increases by 1 (by default) on each iteration.</p>

        <p>Counted loops are used in the following situations.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>When the number of repetitions is known by the programmer.</li>
          <li>When the number of repetitions is inputted by the user.</li>
          <li>When the number of repetitions can be calculated.</li>
          <li>When the number of repetitions is derivable through the logic of the program.</li>
          <li>In the use of advanced data types such as arrays and records.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>They can be very useful in calculations involving series, graphics, and in string manipulation. In character graphics, counted loops can be used to control the location
          of the cursor based on the size of the screen. An example of this is given below.</p>

        <pre class="code">
# The diagonal line program
# ICS2O Unit 4, Activity 4
# Created by R. Kuzmochka
# Edited by K. Spindler

# Variables
ROWS = 25

# Processing and Output
for i in range(0, ROWS):
    # Use the * with the &quot; &quot; to increase the number of spaces
    # i indicates the # number of spaces
    blanks = &quot; &quot; * i

    # Adds the spaces to the asterisk to create the desired output
    print(blanks + &#39;*&#39;)
</pre>

        <p>Type in and run the above program to see how the counted loop can provide a quick way to control simple graphics.</p>

        <p>Counted loops can use the same index variable if they are created one after the other. Once a counted loop is completed the index variable (usually <strong>i</strong>)
          no longer exists. As a result, the variable name can be used again.</p>

        <p>We can modify our pygame animation to use a counted loop instead of an infinite loop, so the ball will stop short of going off the edge of the screen. Notice that only 1
          line has changed; the loop header. Try running this program in Eclipse and notice the difference between this version and the previous animation.</p>

        <h5>Variations on Counted Repetition</h5>

        <p>You can modify the header of a counted loop to change the behaviour of the loop. By adding a third number to the range() function, you can control how the value of the
          index variable changes from one iteration to the next. The following two examples illustrate two counted loop variations; try running them in Eclipse!</p>


        <pre class=code>
# Countdown from 10
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print (i)</pre>

        <pre class=code>
# Counting by twos</span>
for i in range(0, 50, 2):
    print (i)</pre>

        <h4>Nested Loops</h4>

        <p>Nested loops are loops that exist within other loops. Any structure that is contained within another structure such as a loop, must be closed within that structure. This
          is true for all structures in programming. Counted loops can be nested inside infinite loops, conditional loops or other counted loops. In this case, because the index
          variable is still active, each nested counted loop must have a uniquely named index variable. It is traditional usage to name the next index <strong>j,</strong> then
          <strong>k</strong> and so on.</p>

        <p>The following program demonstrates a pygame animation using nested loop to ensure the shape does not move off the page. It uses a series of 4 counted loops, executed in
          sequence, nested inside an infinite loop. Try running this code in Eclipse.</p>

        <h3>Design: Flowcharts</h3>

        <hr />
        <p>Flowcharts are graphical representations of steps used to solve a problem, also called an <strong>algorithm</strong>.<br />
          A basic flowchart contains a starting point, some decisions, some steps, and an ending point. Program flow is directed by arrows.</p>

        <p>When planning out your programs, if there is a repetition structure involved, a simple IPO chart will not be sufficient. Your designs for this activity must involve a
          flowchart. LucidChart is a tool for Google Docs that allows you to easily create flowcharts for your assignments. The following table represents the symbols used in a
          flow chart:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

        <table style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td style="width: 105px; text-align: center;"><strong>Symbol</strong></td>
              <td style="width: 378px; text-align: center;"><strong>Meaning</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td style="width: 105px;"><img src="images/A4terminator.png" /></td>
              <td style="width: 378px;"><strong>Terminator </strong>(used at beginning and end of program)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td style="width: 105px;"><img src="images/A4process.png" /></td>
              <td style="width: 378px;"><strong>Process</strong> (calculation, assigning value, do something)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td style="width: 105px;"><img src="images/A4decision.png" /></td>
              <td style="width: 378px;"><strong>Decision</strong> (question asked, yes/no response only)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td style="width: 105px;"><img src="images/A4IO.png" /></td>
              <td style="width: 378px;"><strong>Input/Output </strong>(user prompts, data entered by user)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td style="width: 105px;"><img src="images/A4arrows.png" /></td>
              <td style="width: 378px;"><strong>Directional Arrows (connect one symbol to another)</strong></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Here is a flowchart showing a conditional repetition structure, and the Python code that could be used to implement it. Notice the use of the value -1 to indicate the
          end of a loop; in computer science this is called a <strong>sentinel value</strong>.</p>

        <hr />
        <h4 class="h4_assignment_title"><img class="icon" src="../resources/images/dropbox.gif" />Programming Exercises</h4>

        <div class="dropbox">
          <p>Save the following programs in the <strong>activity4</strong> package of your Unit 4 Python Project.</p>

          <p>You must complete a <strong>Flowchart</strong> for the first <strong>TWO</strong> of the programs below. Use the Activity 4 evidence card on Hapara for your flowcharts.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Create a program that will ask the user for a large number and for the number to count by. The program is then to count up to the number and then count down to zero
              by the number entered. Name the program <strong>Q1Counting</strong></li>
            <li>Create a program that will allows the user to enter a series of non-zero numbers. When the user is finished, they will enter the number 0, and the program will
              display the sum and average of the numbers entered. Name the program <strong>Q2Average</strong></li>
            <li>Create a program that will place asterisks on the screen. The program should output 25 rows of 80 asterisks, outputting them one at a time (hint: you must use
              nested loops) Name the program <strong>Q3Asterisks</strong></li>
            <li>Using the pygame library, create an interesting sceensaver. You must have animation and objects moving around. You objects should stay on the screen and not move
              off, but should move in more than 1 direction. Make it interesting and have fun! Name the program <strong>Q4ScreenSaver</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <p>Commit and push your code to your GitHub repository EVERY DAY, and submit the Activity 4 evidence card when you are done. It is YOUR responsibility to ensure that your
            code is on Github!</p>
