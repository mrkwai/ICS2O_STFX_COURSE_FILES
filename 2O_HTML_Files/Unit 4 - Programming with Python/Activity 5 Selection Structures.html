      </div>

      <h3>Selection Structures in Python</h3>

      <hr />
      <p>A selection structure is used wherever a program needs different processing, or different output, based on the input or the needs of the user at run time. Selection is
        sometimes referred to as <strong>branching</strong> because one of two or more branches is used based on the results of a <strong>conditional statement</strong>. We have
        seen this before in the header of a while loop. The branch choice is to either continue in the loop or exit the loop based on the results of the conditional statement.</p>

      <pre class="code">

# Generate random numbers: seed() ensures they are actually random
import random
random.seed()

# Variables
userContinue = &#39;y&#39;
userAnswer = 0

# Program Title
print (&quot;Addition Questions Program&quot;)

# User can plan as many times as they like
while userContinue == &#39;y&#39; or userContinue == &#39;Y&#39;::
    # Create the numbers for the addition question
    num1 = random.randint(1, 10)
    num2 = random.randint(1, 10)

    # exit branches out of the second loop when the answer is correct
    while userAnswer != num1 + num2:
        # User Prompt
        print (&quot;Answer the addition question: &quot;)
        print (num1, &quot; + &quot;, num2, &quot; = &quot;, end=&#39;&#39;)

        # Input: User&#39;s response
        userAnswer = int(input())

    # exit branches out of the first loop if user entered &#39;n&#39;
    userContinue = input(&quot;Continue? (y/n)&quot;)</pre>

      <h4>The If Statement</h4>

      <p>In the Python language, a selection structure is created through the use of the <strong>if ... </strong>statement. There are a number of variations on the <strong>if
          ...</strong> statement, such as <strong>if ... else</strong> and <strong>if ... elif ... else</strong>. Each variation creates a different number of branches. Other
        languages (like Java &amp; C++) have more options for selection structures (such as case or switch statements).</p>

      <h5>Simple (One Branch) Selection (if ...)</h5>

      <p>The most basic type of selection has a single, temporary branch. The branch is selected if a condition is met. The syntax of this statement is a follows:</p>

      <pre>
<strong>if <em>&lt;condition&gt;</em>:
    # code to run when condition evaluates to True</strong></pre>

      <p>The <strong>condition</strong> is the same type of condition used for the headers of while loops. If the condition is <strong>True</strong> then the programming code in
        the selection structure is executed. If the condition is <strong>False</strong> then all of the code in the selection structure is ignored.</p>

      <p>The following is an example of pygame animation using the <strong>if ..</strong> statement to detect if the ball has hit the top or bottom, left or right side of the
        screen. It uses the variables <strong>dx</strong> and <strong>dy</strong> to store the change in position of the ball horizontally and vertically.</p>

      <p>When the ball reaches the side of the screen, the <strong>sign (+/-)</strong> of dx or dy is changed. This will make the ball appear to 'bounce' off the sides of the
        screen. Try running this program in Eclipse</p>

import pygame
import random

from pygame import Color
from pygame import draw
from pygame import display
from pygame import time

# Constants
SCREEN_WIDTH = 600
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 400
RADIUS = 30

# Variables

# position of ball
center_x = 250
center_y = 250

# change in position of the ball
dx = random.randint(2, 4)
dy = random.randint(2, 4)

# initialize pygame modules
pygame.init()

clock = time.Clock()

# get a surface for graphics display
gameDisplay = display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))

while True:
    # white background
    gameDisplay.fill(Color('white'))

    # draw the ball
    draw.circle(gameDisplay, Color('purple'), (center_x, center_y), RADIUS)

    # show the graphics on the screen
    display.flip()

    # check for ball hitting the sides; make it bounce
    if center_x + RADIUS > SCREEN_WIDTH or center_x - RADIUS < 0:
        dx = -dx

    # check for ball hitting the top or bottom; make it bounce
    if center_y + RADIUS > SCREEN_HEIGHT or center_y - RADIUS < 0:
        dy = -dy

    # get ready for next frame - move the ball
    center_x += dx
    center_y += dy

    #delay the program to obtain 45 frames per second
    clock.tick(45)</pre>


      <p>In the above example notice that the <strong>if ...</strong> statement is used to change the value of a variable only when it is needed (ie the ball hits the sides of the
        screen). If the change is not needed dx or dy will stay the same and the ball will continue moving in the same direction.</p>

      <h5>Two Branch Selection (if ... else ...)</h5>

      <p>Programming problems are often solved by two or more options that are dependent on the circumstances in the program at the time. This two branch system is a simple
        extension of the <strong>if ...</strong> statement. This approach states that if the first option is not used then the second must be used. This is the <strong>if ...
          else</strong> structure.</p>

      <p>The syntax of this statement is a follows:</p>

      <pre><strong>if <em>&lt;condition&gt;</em>:
    # code to run when condition evaluates to True
else:
    # code to run when condition evaluates to False</strong></pre>

      <p>An example of the use of this structure is below.</p>

      <pre class="code">
# Example of the if ... else ... statement, using two branches.
# This program evaluates whether a person is of driving age.
# ICS2O Unit 4, Activity 6
# Created by R. Kuzmochka
# Edited by K. Spindler

# Constants
DRIVING_AGE = 16

# Input
userAge = int(input(&quot;Please enter your age: &quot;))

# Processing and Output
if userAge &gt;= DRIVING_AGE:
    # user&#39;s age is greater than the driving age
    print (&quot;You can drive!&quot;)
else:
    # user&#39;s age must be less than driving age
    print (&quot;You are too young to drive!&quot;)</pre>

      <h5>Multi Branch Selection (if ... elif ... else ...)</h5>

      <p>While the two branch structure is very useful there are time when many branches are necessary. In these situations it is necessary to use a different structure using the
        <strong>elif</strong> keyword to start a new conditional branch. You can have as many elif statements as required. The syntax for this structure is as follows:</p>

      <pre><strong>if <em>&lt;condition1&gt;</em>:
    # code to run when condition1 is True
elif <em>&lt;condition2&gt;</em>:
    # code to run when condition1 is False and condition2 is True
elif <em>&lt;condition3&gt;</em>:
    # code to run when condition1 and condition2 are False and condition3 is True
else:
    # code to run when all previous conditions are False</strong></pre>

      <p>The <strong>elif</strong> permits the use of multiple conditions. The <strong>first statement</strong> that matches the condition will be implemented, so the order of
        these statements is very important! The <strong>condition</strong> is the same as that used in the header of while loops and in the if ... statements. The use of the
        <strong>else</strong> at the end is optional. Review the following example:</p>

      <pre class="code">
# Example of the if ... elif ... else ... statement, using 3 branches
# This program evaluates if a person is of driving age or needs a retest
# Seniors over 80 require a retest.
# ICS2O Unit 4, Activity 6
# Created by R. Kuzmochka
# Edited by K. Spindler

# Variables
DRIVING_AGE = 16
RETEST_AGE = 80

# Input
userAge = int(input(&quot;Please enter your age: &quot;))

# Processing and Output
if userAge &gt;= DRIVING_AGE and userAge &lt; RETEST_AGE:  #notice the change
    # user&#39;s age is greater than the driving age, but not a senior
    print (&quot;You can drive!&quot;)
elif userAge &gt;= RETEST_AGE:
    # user is a senior and needs to retest for safety reasons
    print (&quot;You will need a retest in order to drive.&quot;)
else:
    # user&#39;s age must be less than driving age
    print (&quot;You are too young to drive!&quot;)</pre>

      <h5>Nested Selection</h5>

      <p>Selection can be nested. This mean that selection can be included in another repetition or selection structure. However, when a selection structure is inside inside
        another selection structure there are several considerations. First, this nested structure will only be activated if the outer selection is True. This means that the
        selection is a secondary selection.</p>

      <p>An example of a nested selection would be the handling of <strong>pygame events</strong>. Events allow a user to interact with the pygame program. </p>

      <p>Add the following code to the <strong>BallBounce.py</strong>, just after the infinite loop header (<tt>while True:</tt>) This code allows the user to interact with the
        program.

        <pre class="code">    # Main Event Loop - get the current event
    for evt in pygame.event.get():

        # Does the user want to quit? (red "x" button on upper right)
        if evt.type == pygame.QUIT:
            quit()

        # make ball respond to keyboard input
        if evt.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if evt.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                dy = random.randint(2, 4)

            elif evt.key == pygame.K_UP:
                dy = -random.randint(2, 4)

            elif evt.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                dx = -random.randint(2, 4)

            elif evt.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                dx = random.randint(2, 4)
</pre>

        <p>This code uses a special type of for loop. Instead of counting numbers, it cycles through the list of events that have been triggered since the last loop. This gives the
          user a chance to interact with the program, though mouse clicks or key strokes.</p>

        <p>There are two main events that this program will detect:
          <ol>
            <li>a <strong>QUIT</strong> event (triggered by the user clicking the red 'x' at the upper right corner of the window)
            <li><strong>KEYDOWN</strong> events (to respond when the user type a key on the keyboard)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>When the user types an arrow key, the ball will respond by moving in that direction.</li>
              <li>A random number (2, 3 or 4) will be used for the dx or dy variable, to give some variance in the movement</li>
              <li>Note that the multi-branch if statement only executes when a <strong>KEYDOWN</strong> event has already been detected</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>

          <h3>Pseudocode</h3>

          <hr />
          <p>Pseudocode is the use of everyday language to describe the operations that the programmer sees as necessary to create a program or solve a problem. Pseudocode does not
            use programming <em>language,</em> but it does use programming <em>concepts</em>. The programmer essentially lays out the required variables and algorithms needed for
            the program before selecting a programming language. It requires that the programmer know the kind of operations that can be performed in a programming language.</p>

          <p>Python, C, C++, Turing, and Java and many other programming languages use the same basic structures (sequence, repetition, selection). What can be created with a
            knowledge of Python commands can be used in other languages such a Turing, C, C++, C# and even Java. Additionally, the pseudocode demonstrates more clearly than the
            actual code the algorithms that the programmer sees as critical to solving the problem.</p>

          <p>As an example, consider writing a program that would find the range of marks in a class, which would be the difference between the lowest and the highest mark. The
            marks are not sorted, so the code must read through the entire list of marks, keeping track of which mark is the lowest and the highest. Assume all marks are in
            percents, so between 0 and 100. The pseudocode would look like the following:</p>

          <pre class="code">
declare a variable highestMark, set to 0
declare a variable called lowestMark, set to 100
declare a variable called done, set to &quot;N&quot;
declare a variable currentMark, to hold the mark the user enters
declare a variable markRange, to hold that final output

while user is still entering marks
    prompt user for mark
    assign currentMark to user input

    if currentMark is less that lowestMark, we have a new low mark
        assign lowestMark to currentMark

    if currentMark is greater than highestMark, we have a new high mark
        assign highestMark to currentMark

    prompt user for Y or N to indicate if they are done entering marks
    assign to done
    back to start of loop

assign markRange to highestMark - lowestMark
output markRange to user
</pre>

          <p>In Python, this code would look like this:</p>

          <pre class="code">
# Mark Range Calculator
# This program will determine the range of a set of marks
# provided by the user
# ICS2O Unit 4, Activity 6
# Created by K. Spindler

# Variables
highestMark = 0
lowestMark = 100
done = &#39;N&#39;

# Loop while user is still entering marks
while done == &#39;N&#39; or done == &#39;n&#39;:
    # Input: ask user for mark
    currentMark = int(input(&quot;Input a mark: &quot;))

    #Processing
    if currentMark &lt; lowestMark:
        # we have a new lowest mark
        lowestMark = currentMark

    if currentMark &gt; highestMark:
        # we have a new highest mark
        highestMark = currentMark

    # prompt the user to continue or end the loop
    done = input(&quot;done marks? Y or N: &quot;)

# Range is the difference between the highest and lowest mark
markRange = highestMark - lowestMark

# Output, newline for readability
print(&quot;\nDifference in marks is &quot;, markRange)</pre>

          <p>In another language (Turing), the code for this program would be:</p>

          <pre class="code">
% Mark Range Calculator
% This program will determine the range of a set of marks
% provided by the user
% Created by K. Spindler

% Declaring Variables
var highestMark, lowestMark, currentMark, markRange : int
var done : string

% Initializing Variables
highestMark := 0
lowestMark := 100

loop
    % Input: ask user for mark
    put &quot;Input a mark&quot;
    get currentMark

    % Processing
    if (currentMark &lt; lowestMark) then
        % we have a new lowest mark
        lowestMark := currentMark
    end if

    if (currentMark &gt; highestMark) then
        % we have a new highest mark
        highestMark := currentMark
    end if

    % Prompt user to continue or end the loop
    put &quot;done marks? Y or N&quot;
    get done

    % End loop when user is done
    exit when done = &quot;Y&quot; or done = &quot;y&quot;
end loop

% Range is the difference between the highest and lowest mark
markRange := highestMark &ndash; lowestMark

% Output, newline for readability
put &quot;\nDifference in marks is &quot;, markRange</pre>

          <p>And here&#39;s what it would look like in Java:</p>

          <pre class="code">

            }
            // prompt the user to continue or end the loop

          <p>Take a moment to review all three implementations of the program, noting their similarities and differences. Notice how the structure of the pseudocode is evident in
            all 3 code snippets. Also notice how much of the information in the pseudocode becomes comments in the actual code. This is one of the benefits to using pseudocode;
            your comments write themselves!</p>
