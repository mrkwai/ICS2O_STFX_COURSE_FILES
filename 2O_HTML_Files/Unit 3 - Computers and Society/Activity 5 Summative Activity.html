      <h3>Computers and Society</h3>

      <hr />
      <p>Now that we have reviewed the many impacts that computers, mobile devices &amp; the Internet have had on our society, our environment, our ethics &amp; our careers, you will have an opportunity to demonstrate what you have learned.</p>

      <p>This assignment will consist of 4 parts. Please ensure you submit all four!</p>

      <div class="dropbox">
        <p><img alt="Drop Box" class="icon" src="../resources/images/dropbox.gif?" />For the first three parts (A, B, C) of the assignment, you are given 3 choices of formats for the final product. If you wish to choose another format, you MUST get my permission first. </p>

        <h4><strong>Part A: Impact on Society - &quot;Then&quot; and &quot;Now&quot;</strong></h4>

        <p>Choose a <b>task</b> that is part of a teenager&#39;s daily life (some ideas: making plans with friends, doing a research project for school, choosing &amp; listening to music, asking your crush out on a date, etc. Be creative!)</p>

        <p>How would that task have been accomplished about 25 years ago? How has technology helped (or hindered) the accomplishment of that task today? Use what we discussed in class, as well as conversations with your parents &amp; other adults to create a comparison of &#39;then&#39; vs &#39;now&#39;. </p>

        <p>You comparison may be done using:</p>

        <p><strong>Comic Strip</strong> - This can be done by hand or using an online tool such as <a href="https://www.storyboardthat.com/" target=_blank>Storyboard That</a> or <a href="https://app.pixton.com/" target=_blank>Pixton</a>. DO NOT simply search for a pre-done image, this must be original! </p>

        <p><strong>Creative writing</strong> - Tell a story to illustrate the comparison. </p>

        <p><strong>Venn Diagram</strong> - Use words and/or symbols to show the similarities and differences. To get a good mark on this format, it must be detailed!</p>
