        <h4><strong>Impact on Society - &quot;Then&quot; and &quot;Now&quot;</strong></h4>

        <p>Choose a <b>task</b> that is part of a teenager&#39;s daily life (some ideas: making plans with friends, doing a research project for school, choosing &amp; listening to music, asking your crush out on a date, etc. Be creative!)</p>

        <p>How would that task have been accomplished about 25 years ago? How has technology helped (or hindered) the accomplishment of that task today? Use what we discussed in class, as well as conversations with your parents &amp; other adults to create a comparison of &#39;then&#39; vs &#39;now&#39;. </p>

        <p>You comparison may be done using:</p>

        <p><strong>Creative writing</strong> - Write a story to illustrate the comparison. Use Book Creator (link on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ocsbstudent.ca/7-12/" target=_blank>student portal</a>, library code in the Google Doc) to share your creativity!</p>

        <p><strong>Venn Diagram</strong> - Use words and/or symbols to show the similarities and differences. To get a good mark on this format, it must be detailed, with words AND images to fully describe the task you have chosen!</p>
