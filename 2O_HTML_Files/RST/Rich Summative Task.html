        <h1>Rich Summative Task</h1>

        <h2>Final Project: Create a Program</h2>
      </div>

      <h3>Summative Assessment</h3>

      <hr />
      <p>Your final project for this course is worth <strong>30% of your final grade</strong> and will allow you to use and demonstrate all of the skills you have developed in this
        course.</p>

      <h4>Step 1: Choosing your Project</h4>

      <p>Your task will be to create a <strong>program of your choosing</strong>. This program could be a game, a quiz application, a utility application that could help someone
        accomplish a task, or something else that you are interested in creating. You program may use graphics with the pygame library, or be entirely text-based.</p>

      <p>Some ideas to inspire your creativity:</p>

      <table width="95%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p>Text Based Games / Programs</p>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p>Graphic Based Games / Programs</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Mad math minute</li>
                <li>Blackjack / 21</li>
                <li>Rock Paper Scissors</li>
                <li>Tic-Tac-Toe</li>
                <li>Yahtzee</li>
                <li>Mastermind</li>
                <li>Hangman</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Whack-a-mole</li>
                <li>Cookie clicker</li>
                <li>Pong</li>
                <li>Flappy Bird</li>
                <li>Dino Runner (chrome no internet game)</li>
                <li>Slither (add extra functionality to the program<br />
                  you created in the pygame tutorial)</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>It is expected that you will use Python for your program; if you wish to use another language/platform please speak with me in person ASAP.</p>

      <p>BEFORE you begin working on your RST, you must submit a project proposal to indicate what you are planning to do. Submit your project proposal by completing the <strong>Step 1: Proposal</strong> form in <a href="https://mystudentdashboard.com/" target="_blank">Hapara </a>.</p>

      <h4>Step 2: Design</h4>

      <blockquote><strong><em><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Those who fail to plan, plan to fail&quot; </span> </em></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(attributed to
          Benjamin Franklin)</span></blockquote>

      <p>Once your proposal has been approved, you may begin your <strong>design</strong>.</p>

      <p>Consider how to break down your idea into major <strong>tasks and sub-tasks</strong>. Plan your work so that it can be completed in <strong>stages</strong>. If you run out
        of time and cannot complete all the tasks, you will still have a working program with fewer features. START SMALL, GET IT WORKING, THEN ADD MORE! Clearly identify the
        <strong>tasks</strong> and <strong>stages</strong> that you will need to develop your program.</p>

      <p>The design must also include a <strong>mock up</strong> (simulated screenshots) of what you intend the final version of your program to look like when it runs. Plan your
        user prompts if doing a text-based game or create some images (MS paint, Google Draw) if you wish to tackle something graphical.</p>

      <p>You will communicate the design of your program with flowcharts, pseudocode, or IPO charts <strong>as needed</strong>. Consider what would be the best tool to fully
        explain
        how your program should function to a third party. This will give you another way to think through your program BEFORE coding.</p>

      <p>Submit your design document (tasks &amp; stages, mock-up, other design techniques) to the dropbox.</p>

      <p><strong>This must be submitted to <a href="https://mystudentdashboard.com/" target="_blank">Hapara</a>.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Late submissions will only be accepted in handwritten format (i.e. computer access will be removed until the design document is finished.)</strong></p>

      <h4>Step 3: Coding</h4>

      <p>Once I have received your design you may begin coding. You should be working <strong>each day</strong> to advance your program. The GitHub link is posted on Hapara: you
        should be able to access it after you submit your design.</p>

      <p>You will push your code to GitHub <strong>EVERY DAY</strong> of the RST so I can see your progress</p>
      Your commit messages must include:

      <ul>
        <li>A brief explanation of what you accomplished during the class</li>
        <li>Explanation of problems encountered or modifications to your design</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Step 4: Testing</h4>

      <p>In addition to testing your game/program thoroughly (preferably as you code it!), you must also have <strong>at least ONE classmate</strong> try running your program as
        well.</p>

      <p>The program tester must complete this <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxFWYYQUbNG6qd5oH8Qi5YtpW1Ta9z-lvr0Yn3vCvxUClLUg/viewform" target="_blank">online form</a></strong> as evidence that they
        tested your program.</p>

      <p>Your mark for this section will come from YOU testing a classmate&#39;s program. You must test AT LEAST ONE classmate&#39;s program for this requirement to be
        fulfilled.</p>

      <h4>Step 5: Final Submission</h4>

      <p>The code that is in your GitHub repository on the last day of regular classes will be considered your submission.</p>

      <p>You must also submit a brief written report reflecting on how the project went. Submit this through <a href="https://mystudentdashboard.com/" target="_blank">Hapara</a>.
      </p>

      <p><strong><a href="RST%20Rubric.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">You will be evaluated according to this rubric</a></strong></p>
