      <h3>Summative Assessment</h3>

      <hr />
      <p>Your final project for this course is worth <strong>10% of your final grade</strong> and will allow you to use and demonstrate the skills you have developed in this
        course.</p>

      <h4>Step 1: Think of a program</h4>

      <p>Your task will be to create a <strong>program of your choosing</strong>. This program could be a game, a quiz, a utility application that could help someone accomplish a
        task, or something else that you are interested in creating. You program may use graphics with the pygame library, or be entirely text-based.</p>

      <p>Some ideas to inspire your creativity (There is a broad range of difficulty!):</p>

      <table width="95%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p>Text Based Games / Programs</p>

                <li>Asteroids</li>
                <li>Flappy Bird</li>
                <li>Tetris</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>It is expected that you will use Python for your program. If you need help getting started, let me know and I can help you with a code skeleton (outline for your program)
      </p>

      <p>BEFORE you begin working on your RST, you must submit a project proposal to indicate what you are planning to do. Submit your project proposal using the <b>Step 1: Proposal</b> evidence card in Hapara.</p>

      <h4>Step 2: Plan your program</h4>

      <blockquote><strong><em><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Those who fail to plan, plan to fail&quot; </span> </em></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(attributed to
          Benjamin Franklin)</span></blockquote>

      <p>Once your proposal has been received, you may begin your <strong>design</strong>.</p>

      <p>Consider how to break down your idea into major <strong>tasks and sub-tasks</strong>. Plan your work so that it can be completed in <strong>stages</strong>. If you run out of time and cannot complete all the tasks, you will still have a working program with fewer features. START SMALL, GET IT WORKING, THEN ADD MORE! Clearly identify the
        <strong>tasks</strong> and <strong>stages</strong> that you will need to develop your program.</p>

      <p>The design must also include a <strong>mock up</strong> (simulated screenshots) of what you intend the final version of your program to look like when it runs. Plan your
        user prompts if doing a text-based game or create some images (MS paint, Google Draw) if you wish to tackle something graphical.</p>

      <p>You will communicate the design of your program with flowcharts, pseudocode, or IPO charts <strong>as needed</strong>. Consider what would be the best tool to fully
        explain how your program should function to a third party. This will give you another way to think through your program BEFORE coding.</p>

      <p>Submit your design document (tasks &amp; stages, mock-up, other design techniques) to the <b>Step 2: Planning</b> evidence card in Hapara.</p>

      <h4>Step 3: Coding and Testing</h4>

      <p>Once I have received your design you may begin coding. You should be working <strong>both in class and at home</strong> to complete your program on time.</p>

      <p>You will push your code to GitHub <strong>EVERY DAY</strong> of the RST so I can see your progress</p>
      <p>Your commit messages must include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A brief explanation of what you accomplished during the class</li>
        <li>Explanation of problems encountered or modifications to your design</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Make sure that you try running your program with a variety of inputs to make sure it works as planned!</p>

      <h4>Step 4: Video Demo</h4>

      <p>Once you are happy with your program, oyu will create a <b>video demo</b> of your program to share with your teacher and classmates.</p>

      <h5>Your demo video should meet the following criteria:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>It should be between 2 - 5 minutes in length</li>
        <li>You should be explaining what is happening from the user's perspective as you run the program</li>
        <li>Your program should show a few different scenarios that might arise, and how your program will handle them</li>
        <li>Your video should be engaging and encourage the viewer to want to give it a try!</li>
